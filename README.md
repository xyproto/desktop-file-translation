# desktop-file-translation

A central repository for localizing all .desktop files in Arch Linux.

* Can generate an `update.sh` script that contains all strings that needs translation.
* The `update.sh` script can then be run in `/usr/share/applications` for applying all the localizations.

Help wanted:

* Adding all of the .desktop files in Arch Linux
* Add localization for all of them
* Creating a transifex project for localizing all of them, possibly extracting all localizations for all desktop files into a single configuration file
